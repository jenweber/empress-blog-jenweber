Many web developers don't realize that they have a significant knowledge gap when it comes to accessibility. This quick self-assessment includes topics that I consider to be basic accessibility knowledge - things that every front end developer should know and learn.

## Goals

The goal of this assessment is to help turn unknown-unknowns into _known_-unknowns. Whenever you identify that you have a learning gap, then you can do something about it! This is progress.

If you miss any of these questions, it's a sign that you could be missing a big part of what it takes to build apps that anyone can use, and should set aside some time to learn ASAP.

## The questions

1. What is a landmark element in HTML? Can you name some?
2. How many `main` elements can you use on a page?
3. What are two ways to associate a label with an input?
4. What does aria-hidden do?
5. When should you use `article` vs `section`?
6. What does `alt` on an image do, and why is it important? Should all images have an `alt`?
7. Is ok to put headings (like `h1`) out of order? If so, when?
8. What does it mean to say that an element is eligible to receive focus? Name some focusable and non focusable elements.
9. What are some CSS properties that would make an element invisible to a screen reader/assistive tech?
10. What are the three levels of WCAG success criteria? Can you give an example of something from each level?
11. How do you start up a screen reader on your computer?
12. How do you decide whether something should be a button or a link?
