Big news, I am starting a newsletter! This is a way to share what I am learning, writing, and celebrating, regardless of what happens with Twitter.

Subscribe here for free: [jenweber.substack.com](https://jenweber.substack.com/p/introducing-the-web-spinning-newsletter)

Newsletter frequency will be twice a month or less. I'm busy, you're busy. It's ok.

All my long-form writing will still be posted here at [https://jenweber.dev](https://jenweber.dev). The newsletter is not a replacement
for this blog, but rather a way for me to share when I have new blog posts, and to share short-form content that I would have put on Twitter.

Hope to see you around!
